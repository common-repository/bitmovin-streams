Bitmovin Streams is Bitmovin’s all-in-one solution to enable you to publish video content online quickly and easily.

== Description ==

Our WordPress plugin gives you the power of Bitmovin’s Streams end-to-end solution and enables you to stream your videos flawlessly across multiple devices with access to in-depth audience and quality analytics.

We built this plugin to make streaming simple for everyone, regardless of the level of video streaming knowledge. Driven by seeing how complex video workflows can be, we’ve combined the best parts of our industry-leading standalone solutions for on-demand and live Encoding, Player, and Analytics to make Bitmovin Streams. This enables you to get to market faster and stream live and on-demand video in the highest quality to your users globally while gathering important & actionable audience data to ensure the best viewing experience.

Bitmovin Streams Plugin enables you to directly upload and host content on the Bitmovin platform, where it is then automatically encoded and embedded on your web page. When video is run through the Bitmovin Encoder, we utilize our Per-Title Encoding, which prepares the video in multiple formats to make viewing on different devices and platforms possible, giving users the best viewing experience, even in low internet connection environments. This allows you to upload video with no need to set any parameters as our best-of-breed VoD Encoder identifies and applies all of the benefits to your content automatically. This ultimately saves you money on cloud storage and CDN delivery costs and making video content available in the highest quality while cutting the bitrate needed to stream it.

Additionally, you’ll have access to data that is tracked from your video streams inside the Bitmovin dashboard. It shows multiple metrics such as how often your video has been streamed, unique users, location, devices used, browsers used, average viewing time, and much more.

All you need is an active [account](https://bitmovin.com/dashboard/account) on Bitmovin, and you can apply our API key that you can use to set up the plugin. Once done, you simply drop the Bitmovin Video block on your page or post, upload a video, and you're done. The block will automatically embed your video on the page once encoded.
